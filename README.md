# Student Habits vs Academic Performance – EDA Project

This project explores the relationship between students' daily habits and their academic outcomes. Using a simulated dataset of 1,000 students, the analysis investigates how behaviors like study time, sleep, screen usage, and exercise impact exam scores and mental health.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze how lifestyle factors affect exam performance.
- Explore whether behaviors like sleep, Netflix usage, or exercise influence mental health.
- Use regression analysis, ANOVA, and data visualization to extract key insights.

## 📊 Key Questions

1. How does study time impact exam scores?
2. Is sleep duration associated with academic performance?
3. Does watching Netflix affect exam results?
4. Is social media usage related to mental health?
5. Does exercise frequency influence mental well-being?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical methods: Linear Regression, ANOVA
- Visualizations: Boxplots, Regplots, Histograms

## 📁 Dataset

Simulated dataset containing:
- Behavioral variables: sleep_hours, study_hours_per_day, netflix_hours, social_media_hours, exercise_frequency, etc.
- Outcomes: exam_score, mental_health_rating
- 1,000 observations
